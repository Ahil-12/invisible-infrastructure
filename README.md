# invisible-infrastructure

## Problem
Campus infrastructure issues are usually addressed only after users complain, leading to downtime and inefficiency.

## Solution
This project implements a background monitoring system that streams infrastructure usage data to the cloud and detects anomalies before failures occur.

## How It Works
- Simulated campus water usage data
- Data streamed to Firebase Realtime Database
- Cloud-executed Python logic monitors patterns
- Alerts triggered before human complaints

## Google Technologies Used
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Google Colab
